# BDiscord

BDiscord is meant as a sample addon for the skript-parser project.

Make sure you are aware of the following:
- It is nowhere near to complete.
- It may not function.
- It is not the best example to use.

You can use the following parts as a reference:
- The main class and registration classes (`BDiscord.java` and the type/converter registration classes)
- The property classes

You should **not** use the following parts as a reference:
- The expression classes (especially the conditions!)
- The TriggerContext implementations (they should be used differently)

There were recently added new features, and this project has been abandoned for quite some months.
Please send me a message if you want help on how to implement your syntax in the best way possible.

If you have any remarks, questions, then send me a message on Discord. My tag is **Mwexim#3563**.
